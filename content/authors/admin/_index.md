Hello! I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant and a Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I have worked in Mobile [Android Java and Flutter] and Web Development [MERN stack, Spring REST]. I love keeping myself updated with the latest technological advancements (current obsession being GraphQL) and aspire to be in the middle of technical development in web and mobile application flora.
